# Information Theory Project 
This is a project from Information theory course(IITU 2018-2019), which divided into 6 parts. __Made by__ [HunT](https://github.com/hunt100), [Fantastic0](https://github.com/Fantastic0) and [Xawdxawdx](https://github.com/xawdxawdx).

*Parts of project:*
* 1 part: Program should find all symbols in the text and compute their probabilities.
* 2 part: Encode the text from the “Text.txt” file using Shannon-Fano or Huffman algorithm with probabilities.
* 3 part: Decode back into text the result  binary sequence from Part2 (Shannon-Fano or Huffman code).
* 4 part: Encode the result  binary sequence from Part 2 with Hamming code (7,4).
* 5 part: Add random errors to the result  binary sequence after Part4 (Hamming code) with a certain interval - only 1 error in every block of 7 bits.
* 6 part: decode Hamming code (find, fix errors and remove redundant bits).
